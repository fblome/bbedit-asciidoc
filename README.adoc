= Syntax Coloring for AsciiDoc in BBEdit

image:https://www.adoc-studio.app/images/icons/adoc-128.png[width=32]
In favour for the all new application https://www.adoc-Studio.app[adoc Studio] the active development of this CLM has been stopped.


== Introduction

This is a BBEdit Codeless Language Module that provides good highlighting for asciidoc files with a  in BBEdit (or the more basic, but free, TextWrangler). 

We are using this Language Module with BBEdit at https://www.projectwizards.net[ProjectWizards] to write the documentation for https://www.projectwizards.net/merlin-project[Merlin Project]. Here you can see  https://www.projectwizards.net/en/support/documentation/merlin-project/handbook[one example].

== Installation

Copy AsciiDoc.plist into ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Language Modules/. If no such folder exists, you may create it.


== Testing with Marked (version 2)

I have written this AppleScript snippet to display the current window of BBEdit in Marked 2 and copied the script to ~/Library/Application Support/BBEdit/Scripts/. If no such folder exists, you may create it.

[source,applescript]
----
	try
		tell application "BBEdit"
			set myFile to get file of front document of window 1
		end tell

		tell application "Marked"
			activate (open myFile)
		end tell
	end try
	
----	

In case you have issues getting Marked running with AsciiDoctor please check this page: https://gist.github.com/mojavelinux/6324279
